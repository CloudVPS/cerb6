Workers are your people, those in your organization who perform various roles through the helpdesk: 
answering e-mail, troubleshooting issues, contacting leads, and so on.  A single worker may belong 
to multiple teams -- such as a person who performs both Support and Sales roles.<br>
<br>
Set up workers by adding <b>one worker e-mail address per line</b> below.  We'll ask for additional 
details on the next step:<br>
<textarea rows="5" cols="50" name="workers">{$workers_str}</textarea><br>

<H3>Mailboxes</H3>

Mailboxes are the primary container for tickets in the helpdesk, and are similar to folders in a 
traditional e-mail client.  Tickets in a mailbox are the responsibility of one or more teams.

Teams are groups of workers in a particular department or on a particular project.  How you define 
your teams is based on how you plan to use the helpdesk.  Many people find it helpful to start with 
a couple department-level teams (Support, Sales, Billing, Abuse) which are broken down into smaller 
groups as needed (by project, by location, by escalation).<br>

Teams are groups of workers.  How you define your teams will depend on you intend to use 
the helpdesk. Many people find it helpful to start with a couple department or project related teams 
(Support, Sales, Billing, Abuse) which are ultimately broken down into smaller groups as needed 
(by project, by location, by escalation).<br>
