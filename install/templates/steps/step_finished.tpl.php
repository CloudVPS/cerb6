<H3>Welcome to the Cerberus Helpdesk community!</H3>

Cerberus Helpdesk 4.0 is the culmination of over 5 years of R&D to 
improve team-based webmail.  As with any such innovation, there may be some 
concepts introduced that are completely new to you and your team.  This is 
especially likely if you are migrating away from desktop e-mail programs to the 
web for the first time.<br>
<br>
The best place to become familiar with the concepts used in Cerberus Helpdesk 
is the <a href="http://wiki.cerberusdemo.com/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">online documentation</a>. 
This area is dedicated to creating and maintaining tutorials, feature guides and best practices.<br>
<br>


<H3>You are now operating in Free Mode</H3>

Each new Cerberus Helpdesk installation defaults to a "Free Mode", allowing nearly 
full-functionality with no expiration.  Companies with lighter requirements may find the free version 
does everything they need.  Go ahead, enjoy!<br>
<br>
For companies which need advanced functionality, or would prefer direct product 
support options, we offer affordable and flexible licensing options.<br>
<br>
